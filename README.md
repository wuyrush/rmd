# `rmd`: Render Markdown doc

As an author writing documents in Markdown syntax, I want a convenient, off-line way to render my Markdown document to HTML and view it.

Ideally, I should be able to:
1. Start rendering from my editor and view result in my browser.
2. Start rendering from my editor and get rendered text.
3. Start rendering from my editor and save rendered result to a new file.
4. Start rendering from command line and output result to stdout or a new file.
